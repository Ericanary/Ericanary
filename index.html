            So I finally got Git Hub Pages pointing to my custom domain after many tumultous hours last night and this evening pulling my hair out and screaming and way too many of <a href="https://twitter.com/knowtheory/status/735293899590144001">these</a> moments that way too accurately decribe my life right now, but EriandCo.com is finally live with some stuff on it! 
            
            This is probably going to be the shitties running blog right now but at least I'll have some kind of record of it for the time being as I make an untold number of changes as I get better at this whole coding thing. I'm actually really curious as to how this is all going to play out, but I've got a digital image archive that I'm starting of all of the iterations of the site day-by-day to track it's evolution as I grow. I think that's going to be a cool project in and of itself. On the plus side I have hooked one of the girls at work into learning HTML with me so now I have a <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/whos-your-coding-buddy/">coding buddy</a>! She actually introduced me to the the concept of <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/">rubber duck programming/debugging</a>, which I think is hilarious! It might be time to get me a little rubber ducky friend.

            Hi! My name is Erin and I'm a self-proclaimed non-techie who loves baking, reading, pinterest, dogs, and for some unknown reason trying to become some kind of kick-ass programmer. Say what!? Here's the start of this blog, which is my first foray into blogging and programming - starting with HTML, CSS, Javascript (apparently this is different than Java????), and JQuery. Who know's where my adventures will take me, but I need this project to keep me motivated to continue working on learning and honing my web developer (web dev) chops.
