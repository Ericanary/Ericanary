            Hi! My name is Erin and I'm a self-proclaimed non-techie who loves baking, reading, pinterest, dogs, and for some unknown reason trying to become some kind of kick-ass programmer. Say what!? Here's the start of this blog, which is my first foray into blogging and programming - starting with HTML, CSS, Javascript (apparently this is different than Java????), and JQuery. Who know's where my adventures will take me, but I need this project to keep me motivated to continue working on learning and honing my web developer (web dev) chops.
